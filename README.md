# Aisha's Challenges

Run `npm i` to install 3rd party libraries.
Run `npm run <problem number>` to run a specific problem e.g `npm run 1`

Write your solution for each challenge in the `solution.js` file.


# Aisha's Framework For Problem Solving

## 1. Conditionals (if, switch)

**LANGUAGE**: Only, if, search, match, find, where, when, check

```javascript
if (name === "Aisha") {
  goToFront();
}


if (accountBalance > 0) {
  makePayment();
}
```

## 2. Loops (for, while)

**LANGUAGE**: Search, Lists, each, every, the rest, all

```javascript
for(i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
  makeSalaryPayment();
}

const tracker = 0;
while(thereArePeople && !AishaFound) {
  searchForAisha();
  tracker = tracker + 1
}
```

## 3. Variables

**LANGUAGE**: inputs, store for later

## 4. Functions

Do stuff for you and are reusable

#### MY FRAMEWORK FOR SOLVLING PROBLEMS

1. Write it in english (identify inputs and outputs), the how matters
2. Notice the terminology/ language you are using
3. Match it to the above programming constructs
4. Write code
